# "file command" rules for PKLITE-compressed DOS EXE files
#
# By Jason Summers, 2024 - Not copyrighted

# Goals:
# - Identify PKLITE-compressed EXE files, including those made by:
#   - Professional versions of PKLITE
#   - Various special unreleased versions of PKLITE, used to compress
#     PKWARE's software. This includes the executable part of some
#     self-extracting ZIP files.
# - Identify even files that use low-tech obfuscation: erasure of the
#   copyright message, or of the "Not enough memory" error message, etc.
# - Print the likely version number of PKLITE that made the file.
# - Report if a PKLITE-compressed file is also a ZIP2EXE-style self-
#   extracting ZIP archive.

# Non-goals:
# - Identify files from the leaked beta version of PKLITE (that's done
#   separately).
# - Identify compressed COM format (that's done separately).
# - Identify PKLITE/PKLITE32-compressed Windows executables.
# - Identify self-extracting ZIP files that aren't also PKLITE-compressed.
# - Fingerprint the version of PKLITE that made the file.
# - Identify files made by high-tech obfuscators, such as MEGALITE and
#   UN2PACK.
# - Identify files that use a simple obfuscation trick other than
#   those listed as goals.
# - Print various properties of the file, beyond the version number.

# We allow some tolerance, such as for a PK\7\8 muti-volume marker,
