# Set the current offset to the number of full pages (i.e., 1 less
# than the # of pages).
# This is a hack. The number of full pages is not a number of bytes.
#
# Type 'clear' is used for convenience as a zero-length type -- it
# doesn't add anything extra to the offset.
# If you don't like it, here's an alternative to the next 2 lines:
#>>(4.s-1)        byte       x
#>>>(&-1.b*512)   offset     x
# Note that "(4.s-2)" wouldn't work, because it will fail if this
# field has value 1. "(4.s-1)" is okay, because 0 is not a valid
# value for this field.

>>(4.s-1)        clear      x

# Multiply the current offset by 512.
# !!! This relies on undocumented behavior.
# When type 'offset' is used with an indirect offset, it takes
# the starting offset at which the first read would happen,
# performs math on it, and sets the current offset to the result.
# (The value read from the file is thrown away, though its type can
# have an effect on the kind of arithmetic used. Using a large
# integer like ",q" seems safest.)
# This allows us to subtract 1, then multiply by 512.
# (Another way to do it would be to multiply by 512, then subtract 512.
# That's easy to do in two lines, without black magic. The problem is
# that the intermediate offset may be beyond the end of the file, and
# such offsets are not allowed.)
>>>(&0,q*512)    offset     x

# Add the "# of bytes in last page", and read 1 byte to confirm
# existence of an overlay.
>>>>&(2.s)       byte       x

# Set the current offset to the position of the overalay
>>>>>&-2         byte       x
